## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard contains multiple pages analyzing:

- 🚧 **Accidents by Hour** – Understand when most accidents occur
- 📅 **Accidents by Day** – Weekly accident trends
- 🌦 **Top Weather Conditions** – How weather influences accident frequency
- 📍 **Map View of Accident Hotspots** – Using Start_Lat and Start_Lng
- ⚠️ **Severity Analysis** – Visualize accident impact severity

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**  
- **Power Query Editor** for data transformation  
- **Map Visuals** for location-based insights  
- Basic DAX calculations and field aggregation
